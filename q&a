3.	Simulate BER performance over Rayleigh Fading wireless channel with BPSK transmission for SNR 0 to 60 dB. 
	Explain Rayleigh Fading wireless channel
Rayleigh fading is a model used to describe the wireless channel's behavior. It assumes that the transmitted signal experiences random variations in magnitude and phase due to multiple reflections and scattering.
	Explain types of fading techniques
	Slow Fading: In slow fading, the variations in the channel occur over a timescale much larger than the symbol duration. The fading effect is relatively predictable, allowing for effective equalization and error correction techniques. Examples of slow fading are encountered in environments with large distances between the transmitter and receiver, where the channel variations occur gradually over time.
	Fast Fading: In fast fading, the channel variations occur rapidly, comparable to or faster than the symbol duration. The fading effect is highly unpredictable and can lead to rapid changes in the received signal strength and quality. Fast fading is commonly experienced in environments with significant multipath propagation, such as urban areas, where the reflected signals from buildings and other objects cause rapid variations.

5.	To understand the handover mechanism.
	Explain Handoff 
handoff refers to the process of transferring an ongoing call or data session from one base station (or access point) to another, while maintaining continuous connectivity and service quality for the user. Handoff is essential for providing seamless mobility in cellular networks and other wireless systems.
	 Types of Handoffs
	Intra-cell Handoff: This type of handoff occurs when a mobile device moves within the coverage area of a single cell but encounters variations in signal quality or other factors. The handoff process involves transferring the connection to a different channel or frequency within the same cell to maintain a better signal quality and minimize interference.
	Inter-cell Handoff: Inter-cell handoff happens when a mobile device moves from one cell to another. This occurs in cellular networks with multiple cells and base stations. The handoff process involves transferring the connection from the current base station to a neighboring base station that provides better signal strength or capacity in the new coverage area.
o	Hard Handoff: A hard handoff involves an immediate transfer of the connection from the current base station to the new base station. There is a brief interruption during the handoff process, and the connection is switched to the new base station completely.
o	Soft Handoff: Soft handoff, also known as softer handover, allows a mobile device to be simultaneously connected to multiple base stations during the handoff process. This enables a seamless transition as the device maintains connections with both the previous and new base stations. Soft handoff improves call quality, signal strength, and overall reliability, especially in areas with overlapping cell coverage.
o	Softer Handoff: Softer handoff is an enhanced version of soft handoff that allows the mobile device to connect to more than two base stations simultaneously during the handoff process. This provides further redundancy and ensures better coverage and quality.
